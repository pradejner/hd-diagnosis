# Heart Disease Diagnosis Prediction

This GitHub repository contains a Python project that utilizes a heart disease dataset provided by UCI Cleveland, available on Kaggle. The project aims to train a machine learning model using the dataset and deploy it in a Streamlit application. The trained model predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various input parameters.

## Dataset

The heart disease dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Cleveland database, accessible through Kaggle. The dataset contains 14 attributes that describe different aspects of a patient's health, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiographic results. It also provides the target variable, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

To use this dataset, you can download it from the following Kaggle link: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/heart-disease-dataset)

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
├── data/
│   ├── heart.csv
├── models/
│   ├── heart_disease_model.pkl
├── src/
│   ├── train_model.py
├── streamlit_app/
│   ├── app.py
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
```

- The `data` directory holds the heart disease dataset (`heart.csv`), which should be placed in this folder before running the project.
- The `models` directory stores the trained model (`heart_disease_model.pkl`), which will be generated by the `train_model.py` script.
- The `src` directory contains the Python script (`train_model.py`) responsible for training the model using the heart disease dataset.
- The `streamlit_app` directory consists of the Streamlit application (`app.py`) that utilizes the trained model to predict heart disease based on user inputs.
- `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control.
- `README.md` is the current file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
